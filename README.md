I really like working and Clojure and I like it even better when others can
experience that joy too. This is just an opinionated scaffold for getting
started with Clojure in a Devcontainer right away.

## Devcontainer

For ease of use, developers can start working in pre-built ready made
development environments via [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). Codespaces are fully configured
dev environments in the cloud with a free tier of up to 60 hours a month free.

See `.devcontainer/` for more details.

[![Open in GitHub
Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=612030802)

The environment comes with the following pre-installed to start working with
Clojure right away:

- babashka
- calva
- clojure
- leiningen
